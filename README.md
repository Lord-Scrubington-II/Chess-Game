# Chess-Game
An unassuming chess game. (WIP)

## Features
This is a chess app built in Unity Game Engine, designed for Android and PC builds. However, it is not your average chess game. 

The game is populated by a (soon-to-be) large selection of "levels," which consist of board configurations that would certainly make your local chess master turn their head twice.

Would it be more appropriate to call it bad chess? Perhaps, and perhaps not. If one looks closely enough, one may be greeted by a familiar sight.

Future planned features include an AI player, a settings menu, additional *bad chess* levels, a **very special** level, and more.

## Attributions
Chess is an ancient game, so it entered the public domain many ages ago.

This project began its existence, in a manner of speaking, as the foundation for a game development project at my university. I must thank my former supervisor for letting me keep the code I had originally written.

To help get this project off the ground, I consulted myriad online resources - in particular, the Unity API documentation, Microsoft's C# .NET Docs, and StackOverflow (who doesn't?). Very helpful was also the beginning of a video series by Youtube user Etredal, which may be viewed here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFZeeTZ29w0&list=PLXV-vjyZiT4b7WGjgiqMy422AVyMaigl1&index=2. 
However, I have completely (and I mean completely) overhauled the architecture of the game in preparation for the implementation of future features, as well as for long-term maintainability - and also as a general exercise in foundational software development practices.
